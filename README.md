# Basic Calculator
This is the basic calculator which performs some operations like addition, subtraction, etc.

The code supports many basic operations, such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Remainder, Greatest Integer Function, Signum Function, and Modulus.

I added more operations like the signum function and the greatest integer function.

In the future, I will add more basic operations to the code, like the least integer function and many more.
